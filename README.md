## 1 Background
Jvedio is a video management software that integrates local video recognition and scanning, picture display, screening, and scraping. At present, the similar management software on GitHub includes: [jellyfin](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin), [Emby](https://github.com/MediaBrowser/Emby), and the existing software on the market includes : Extreme Shadow Pie, KODI, PLEX, etc.

|Software|Main Writing Language|Support Platform|

|jellyfin|C#|All platforms|
|Emby|C#|All platforms|
|Jiyingpai|?|Window|
|KODI|?|-|
|PLEX|?|-|


### 1.1 The original intention of the development

With more and more videos stored on the computer, the desire for a good video management software becomes stronger. After using emby and PLEX, I found some **problems**:

- Startup method: start a server first, and then use WEB to manage the software
- Information storage method: Put pictures and metadata information together in the same directory of the movie, which leads to very troublesome information transfer
- Interface: The WEB writing interface is efficient and simple, but I really hope that the margins, shadows, zoom behavior, maximize and minimize buttons of the form can be fully customized
- Function: Data filtering is not rich enough
- Feelings: lack of a video management software developed by the Chinese

Therefore, I developed Jvedio. In order to deepen my understanding of Jvedio and video management, many functions and modules are written from scratch, including interface, function, crawler, database management, etc.


### 1.2 About the code

I haven't studied C# systematically, but I have heard the name of C#, it can do anything, and it is very convenient and simple, so the code I wrote may look crappy, but it does not matter, I know I will continue to grow , Jvedio will also attract more people to come in and continue to optimize and improve, and I can see a bright future.

There are not many obscure things in Jvedio's code. I try to implement a function in the simplest way.


## 2 Installation

Jvedio currently does not have an installation package. The software is released and stored as compressed files. After the updated version, if there is no special instructions, you can overwrite the source files after decompression.
